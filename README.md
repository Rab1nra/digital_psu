##     IoT Based Variable Programmable digital Power Supply with ESP8266

Hey everyone, it’s Rabindra here and , and I’m excited to share another project with you today. We will make an IoT-based variable Programmable digital Power Supply using ESP8266. Unlike standard designs with potentiometers, which can be unreliable and non-linear, we’re aiming for accuracy. So today I will show you a boring, theoretical but accurate method for making a digital  power supply, but its accuracy makes it worth the effort.

I am sharing the Pio project you may need to install some libraries , and if you are facing issues then i've also shared my libraries folder you just need to extract it in the arduino/libraries under documents folder

If you planned to use pio then you need to edit the config files you need to open config file and under lib_deps you need to change the path of all the libraries to you arduino/libraries
